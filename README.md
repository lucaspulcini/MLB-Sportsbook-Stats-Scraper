# MLB-Sportsbook-Stats-Scraper
This project involves an advanced web scraping solution designed to gather MLB pitcher prop data from DraftKings, alongside relevant statistics from Razzball and BaseballSavant. By integrating data from these sources, the project aims to create a comprehensive dataset that provides insights into pitcher performance against upcoming opponents.

The DraftKings scraper is specifically structured to facilitate seamless data storage in an Excel file, enabling the tracking of historical prop lines. This historical data allows for analysis of past trends, helping identify favorable betting opportunities in the future.

While this tool offers a streamlined approach to accessing relevant information for sports betting, it does not guarantee gambling success. Instead, it serves as an engaging project that has the ability to identify potentially advantageous betting lines while eliminating the need to spend time searching for these statistics.
